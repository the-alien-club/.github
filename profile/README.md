# Hello There !

**Alien.club** is a Web3.0 and AI venture studio that specializes in the creation of future looking technoligical solutions to pressing challenges. To do so, we have three fundational values:

-**OPEN**: Innovation always builds upon knowledge. To build in an open manner increases our capacity to innovate and establish new markets.
- **SOVEREIGN**: Given the current data monopoly of a few tech actors, we believe that giving back sovereignty over actions to our customers is a requirement.
- **COOPERATIVE**: Collective intelligence and cooperation have been key drivers of changes. We aim to introduce innovative economic models with collaboration at its core.

## Projects
### Remix NFT

The Remix NFT protocol is a new standard created to generate a value model based upon the philosophy of the Creative Common licensing. The protocol is made of three modules that can be combined to maximize the incentives for artists, investors and collectors to purchase unique copies of digital artworks, while nonetheless promoting the Creative Commons values of free and open culture:

- A fair and redistributive royalty chain.
- A license and remix right management.
- A protective copyleft system.
